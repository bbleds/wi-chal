# React/Redux To-dos
A simple to-do application utilitizing localStorage for persistent data and built via React/Redux 

# MVP
 1. As a user I can add an item to a list of "to-dos".
 2. As a user I can see a list of "to-do" items.
 3. As a user I can complete an item on the "to-do" list.

# Running Locally
  1. First, you will need to be sure that you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. At the time of this build, I am running node@v8.9.3 and npm@v5.6.0.
  2. Clone down the repositiory to your local machine ```git clone https://github.com/bbleds/wi-chal.git```.
  3. Install dependencies ```cd wi-chal && npm install```
  4. Spin up the app ```npm run start'''. 
  5. You can now navigate to ```localhost:4000``` in your favorite browser and manage your to-dos as needed!
